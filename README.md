Not all work here is from me. All `.pdfs` are provided from the course professor and I do not own it.
I am sharing my personal repo for it to be seen. You can discuss it with me if you want to. I am open to any suggestions and improvements, but will not accept any submissions.

Most of my work (solutions) will be inside `*/AulaN/solutions/` folder, with a Poetry project. Code not under the Poetry project is not mine.
All code written by me is under the MIT License.
